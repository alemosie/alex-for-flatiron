Languages: Ruby, HTML/CSS

I recently started going through the Flatiron pre-work on Learn, and I wanted to test and build upon my new knowledge of Ruby by writing a few programs! Given that a goal of the application process is to get a sense of who I am as a person, the programs I've created in the AboutMe directory touch upon various passions in my life -- ukulele, language learning, and Irish dancing -- in mostly game-ified form. As an added "why not," I also created an HTML/CSS page based on some knowledge from the Codecademy course, which contains the Flatiron app I submitted in the first round of the process. 

Enjoy, and feel free to reach out with any questions!
