    <h3>Flatiron Application</h3>

    <h4>In 140 characters or less, tell us what makes you unique.</h4>
      <p><a href="http://www.feisworx.com/compresult.php?feis=124&comp=6B">Irish dancing</a>, ukulele-playing, polyglot grammar geek that wants to make the government work better through code.</p>

    <h4>Why are you applying to the Flatiron School?</h4>
      <p>For the last year or so I have been learning to code online. I can attribute a lot of my basic coding skills to sites like <a href=https://www.codecademy.com/learn>Codecademy</a>, and have supplemented learning with hack nights in the local D.C. lady tech scene. However, I still feel like I am coding in a vacuum &#8212; there is little connection between the work I do all day and the learning I do when I come home.  I&#8217;m frustrated when the seasoned developers in the office have to take over for the hard stuff, but I don&#8217;t have the skill set quite yet to champion the process from ideation to production. As someone who loves the sink-or-swim approach to learning, I know that a coding bootcamp will push me through the barrier that separates &quot;playing with code&quot; from &quot;working with code,&quot; and I am confident that I would thrive in a full-time development role.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m drawn to Flatiron specifically because of the community aspect the school strives to build. I appreciate the laser focus on New York, the emphasis on &quot;class&quot; rather than &quot;person&quot; during the admissions process, and the commitment to diversity: not just racial, gender, etc., but also background, expertise, and vision. Flatiron places as much value on those from a humanities background than those from STEM fields, evident throughout Quora and the blogging presence that the school cultivates. I currently work in a development lab where I have been not just the only one without a STEM degree, but also the only woman, and have experienced the uphill battle in assimilating into the homogenous culture. I like that Flatiron recognizes that with the right drive and support network, all types of people can be successful in the world of code.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m also excited by the rigor of Flatiron&#8217;s program. As a practitioner of human languages, I have thrown myself into a variety of challenging situations abroad &#8212; I worked as a reporter on a local newspaper during the fair election protests with only a year of Russian under my belt, and road-tripped across Costa Rica without having spoken Spanish in 5 years. These experiences and many others taught me the value of actively foraying into unfamiliar territory; faced with a goal I derive from the proficiency of those around me, I am forced to charge at it full speed ahead. Flatiron offers a similar model for code, and I&#8217;m looking forward to growing in an environment that doesn&#8217;t hold back.</p>


    <h4>Tell us about your professional/educational career to date. What are you up to now and how did you end up there?</h4>
      <p>In college, I studied Russian language and literature, and upon graduation began working for the government as a Russian language analyst. This straightforward path, however, had a technical twist; a large part of the work involved learning to use browser-based tools to conduct analysis. The workflows were complex, requiring numerous steps to piece together a cohesive report on the topic at hand. Certain tasks took days &#8212; and upwards of 10 tools &#8212; to complete. When I was first learning the process, I was frustrated by the time it took; my colleagues offered their personal shortcuts, but mostly shook their heads and said, &quot;Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the way it is.&quot;</p>

      <p>Soon I realized that the aforementioned &quot;way&quot; didn&#8217;t need to exist. In fact, the reason why collective frustration was so high was not due to the inherent complexity of the process, but because our tools were not developed with analyst requirements in mind; they were created by developers that had little insight into the workflow. With a few changes to the tools, a seemingly difficult task could become simpler. I began to engage developers directly and offer my perspective, and minor tweaks started to result in significant gains for analysts, reducing time and stress in favor of a clear path forward.</p>

      <p>Seeing this progress, I took my engagement up a notch, and recently shed my analyst role altogether to sidesaddle with developers and work on the technologies that power analysis. I took the initiative to be reassigned from a traditional analyst role to a cloud analytic development lab, where I devise and manage analytic products focused on improving analysis. As product lead, I work alongside Java and Pig programmers to bring analysts&#8217; visions to life: answering the analytical &#8217;what ifs&#8217; through intensive data wrangling and custom visualizations. It has been a firehose of technical information, but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed being surrounded by makers, and to participate in the making process myself.</p>

    <h4>Describe your background with computer programming. Please be as detailed as possible. Feel free to include links to any applications you've built, courses you've completed, etc...</h4>

    <p>As a product lead in an analytics lab, I participate in the development process, working closely with technical mentors to write basic features in Java and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(programming_tool)>Pig</a> (a Map/Reduce framework). I&#8217;ve bolstered elementary coding skills through courses at the George Washington University (Introduction to Computers and the Internet) and University of Maryland, Baltimore County (Introduction to Java Programming). I also completed Codecademy&#8217;s Python track, and took a short seminar on Python applications for data science through work. As a result of the classes and on-the-job training, I&#8217;m able to generate simple scripts in Python and Java, and collaborate with developers to whiteboard an approach to more complex programs.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I balance out the data-focused projects with what I consider more art: web and mobile development. Currently, I&#8217;ve teamed with a developer and interactive designer to create an Android app called <a href=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1716/24544881420_fa10c50204_z.jpg>Kitchnik</a>, which seeks to eliminate personal food waste by tracking perishable purchases. (My forgetful roommate was a compulsive food shopper &#8212; for the sake of our fridge, I had to tackle the problem somehow!) In that process, I&#8217;ve developed a verifiable obsession with User Experience (UX); as I had learned from work, putting an emphasis on end users&#8217; needs and habits is crucial to the success of the final product. I took Udacity&#8217;s <a href=https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud849>UX Design for Mobile Developers</a> course, and am working through the <a href= https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837>Android Development for Beginners course</a>, where I&#8217;ve learned elementary XML to develop views.</p>

    <p>My passion for web development goes back a bit further; I had my first brush with HTML and CSS when I was just edging into my teenage years. I used to participate in an online gaming community called Neopets, where I would spend literally hours not playing the plethora of games offered, but creating a layout for my user profile. I&#8217;d scour the internet for layouts I liked, and to make it my own tinker with the HTML and CSS code to figure out what caused what &#8212; img src here to add a background to that part, replacing a hex color and adding styling there to fix a table border. I didn&#8217;t realize that I was learning to code until much later in life, and those skills have surprisingly stuck. I whizzed through Codecademy&#8217;s HTML and CSS course, and am currently working through their Javascript course. I&#8217;tve also played with General Assembly&#8217;s online platform Dash to gain exposure to more types of projects. The markup and styling languages have provided me with a background in web design and information manipulation, and now I&#8217;m hungry to learn more about the powerful programming tools that make the website function as a whole.</p>

  <h4> The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts)</h4>

    <p>Recently, I have had the pleasure of engaging in the extremely difficult issue involved in any move to New York City: downsizing. Its complexity stems from a number of factors: 1) I have inherited furniture from my sentimental mother; 2) I am moving to an apartment that has half the space; 3) I live with my partner, whose things I (unfortunately) cannot toss without permission. Succinctly, I have lots of stuff, no space to put it, and no agency to deal with all of it.</p>

    <p> My approach was to break down the problem into three steps. First, I assigned a value to each item I own. I did this by gathering things by category, bundling clothes, cookware, furniture, and other similar items together. I then individually handled each item using a repeatable process: engage with the item; assess for quality; assess for usefulness; assess for emotional attachment; and combine assessments for overall score of &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;donate.&quot;</p>

    <p> Second, once I had identified the items I wished to keep, I considered the valued items as a whole. What combination of things could I keep, given the space constraints &#8212; including space taken up by the stuff that was not mine? For example, I have a couch, a love-seat, and a large kitchen table with chairs, all of which I want to bring to New York, but for which there is not enough space. Can I fit the couch, table, and chairs together? What about the couch, love-seat, and table, sans chairs? I also had to take positioning into account. I wasn&#8217;t going to put the couch in the kitchen, and the table in the bedroom; I needed to figure out what should go where to determine whether there was enough space.</p>

    <p> Lastly, I evaluated each of these combinations. Which combination did I like more: the couch and the table, or the couch and love-seat? Using the value system I employed in the first stage, I ranked the combinations based on quality, usefulness, and sentimental attachment to come up with the winning items that are making it to New York.</p>

    <h4>Is there anything else you'd like us to know?</h4>

    <p> My favorite way to practice a new programming language is to write a <a href=https://codeawan.wordpress.com/2015/08/30/a-tale-of-three-pigs/>fairy tale in code</a>. After struggling with some of the more quantitative problems in the coding tutorials early on, I was reflecting one day on my undergraduate thesis, which delved into the early Soviet regime&#8217;s handling of Russian Imperialist fairy tales in the classroom. The fairy tale has survived through the ages because of its endearing simplicity; the stories are systematic, with clearly defined characters, actions, and outcomes. As such, this structure can be easily abstracted onto a programming language. Take, for example, the story of the three little pigs: 3 pigs and 3 materials out of which they&#8217;re building their houses (organized into indexed lists); 1 wolf; and a repeated action (a function) of attempting to blow the pigs&#8217; houses down. Depending on the material, the wolf fails or succeeds (a boolean). This exercise has helped me contextualize more advanced programming concepts in object-oriented languages, too &#8212; for example, while learning Java, I created superclasses and subclasses to depict the three pigs. While I understand that in a traditional curriculum coding and CS fall under the STEM umbrella, I love applying code to things beyond an <a href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos126/assignments/nbody.html>N-Body Simulation</a>: whether leveraging Russian language learning practices for programming languages, or generating art through code from the blank canvass of a web page or phone screen. Viva coding and the humanities!</p>
